# 🧠 Lifestyle & Activity Prediction using ML
This project aims to predict user activities and lifestyle preferences based on behavioral data. It explores multiple machine learning architectures, ranging from traditional classifiers to Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks.

📊 Business Value
Understanding user lifestyle is key for Super Apps (like LINE MAN Wongnai) to provide personalized recommendations and optimize marketing campaigns.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
Language: Python.
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
Models Used: * MLPClassifier (Neural Network): Used for capturing complex patterns in activity data.
Random Forest / Decision Trees: Used for baseline comparison and feature importance.
Preprocessing: Feature encoding, data cleaning, and handling categorical variables.

📈 Key Insights from Notebooks
Activity Prediction: Implementation of a neural network approach to classify user activities.
Preference Analysis: Analyzing the relationship between user demographics and their favorite lifestyle choices.
